## 📖 About the Project

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze clinical and genomic data for two primary goals:
1.  **Prognosis Prediction:** To predict the likely course and outcome of cancer in a patient.
2.  **Treatment Selection:** To recommend the most effective treatment options tailored to an individual's profile.

The aim is to build a reliable tool that can assist oncologists in making data-driven decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## ✨ Features

- **Prognosis Prediction:** Predicts patient survival rates or recurrence likelihood.
- **Treatment Recommendation:** Suggests personalized treatment plans.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts for cleaning and preparing raw medical data.
- **Model Training:** Notebooks and scripts to train various ML models.

## ⚙️ Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Mayurdoiphode55/Machine-Learning-and-AI-in-Cancer-Prognosis-Prediction-and-Treatment-Selection.git](https://github.com/Mayurdoiphode55/Machine-Learning-and-AI-in-Cancer-Prognosis-Prediction-and-Treatment-Selection.git)
    cd Machine-Learning-and-AI-in-Cancer-Prognosis-Prediction-and-Treatment-Selection
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your packages.)*

## 🔑 Configuration

To use the generative AI or chatbot features, you need a Google AI API key.

1.  **Get your API Key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project.
3.  **Add your API key** to the `.env` file like this:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    The project code will use this file to access your key securely.

## 🚀 Usage

The general workflow for this project is as follows:

1.  **Prepare the data** using the scripts in the `data` or `code` folders.
2.  **Train a model** by running the Jupyter Notebooks.
3.  **Use the trained model** for making predictions on new data.

## 🧠 Model Information

This project explores various machine learning models (such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks) to find the best-performing algorithm for this task. The models are evaluated using standard classification metrics to determine the most accurate and reliable approach for prognosis and treatment prediction.
