## üìñ About the Project

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze clinical and genomic data for two primary goals:
1.  **Prognosis Prediction:** To predict the likely course and outcome of cancer in a patient.
2.  **Treatment Selection:** To recommend the most effective treatment options tailored to an individual's profile.

The aim is to build a reliable tool that can assist oncologists in making data-driven decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Prognosis Prediction:** Predicts patient survival rates or recurrence likelihood.
- **Treatment Recommendation:** Suggests personalized treatment plans (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts for cleaning and preparing raw medical data.
- **Model Training:** Notebooks and scripts to train various ML models.
- **Interactive Chatbot (Optional):** An interface to interact with the model and get predictions.

## üìä Dataset

The model was trained on the `[Name of Your Dataset, e.g., TCGA, SEER, or custom dataset]`.

- **Source:** [Link to the dataset or describe its source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository, etc.]
- **Description:** [Briefly describe the dataset, including the number of samples, features, and the target variable.]
- **Key Features:** `[e.g., Gene expression data, tumor size, patient age, mutation status, etc.]`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Mayurdoiphode55/Machine-Learning-and-AI-in-Cancer-Prognosis-Prediction-and-Treatment-Selection.git](https://github.com/Mayurdoiphode55/Machine-Learning-and-AI-in-Cancer-Prognosis-Prediction-and-Treatment-Selection.git)
    cd Machine-Learning-and-AI-in-Cancer-Prognosis-Prediction-and-Treatment-Selection
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your packages.)*

## üöÄ Usage

To run the project, follow these instructions.

1.  **Run the data preprocessing script:**
    ```sh
    python code/preprocess_data.py
    ```

2.  **Train the model:**
    Open and run the Jupyter Notebook for training.
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook notebooks/model_training.ipynb
    ```

3.  **Run the application (e.g., a Flask app or a script for prediction):**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## üß† Model Architecture

This project uses a `[Your Model Name, e.g., Random Forest Classifier, Neural Network, etc.]`.

- **Algorithm:** [Briefly explain why you chose this algorithm.]
- **Key Hyperparameters:** [List any important hyperparameters you tuned, e.g., learning rate, number of trees.]
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The model's performance was evaluated using `[e.g., Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC]`.

## üìà Results

The final model achieved the following performance on the test set:

- **Accuracy:** `[e.g., 95%]`
- **Precision:** `[e.g., 0.92]`
- **Recall:** `[e.g., 0.94]`
- **F1-Score:** `[e.g., 0.93]`

[You can also add a confusion matrix image or other plots here to showcase results.]
